# Cool Pool

This game was created as the Summer term project for SCC110.
The purpose of this project was to create my own version of 8-ball pool, 
including a white cue ball, a black 8-ball, and red/blue balls to represent
stripes and solids, while
mimicking the real rules as close as possible.

The game is made to be played as simply and intuitively as possible, using only the mouse
and the left and right mouse buttons. The right mouse button is used to place
the ball either:
- At the start of the game (Limited to left of the table line)
- When a foul has occurred, including when the white ball has been potted.

While the left mouse button allows the players to shoot the ball, with
the power being determined using the length of the line drawn from the ball.
